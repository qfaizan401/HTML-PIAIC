                <li>Version Control with Git</li>
                <p>
                    You won't find a top programmer, web developer, or AI engineer who doesn't use 
                    version control. This is true because version control helps developers produce 
                    better results and makes collaboration easy. Around the world, in teams both large and 
                    small, Git is an essential part of the toolchain. This module covers Git and Github.

                <li>Object Oriented and Functional Programming using Python</li>
                <p>
                    In the second module of the program, students will learn about basic programming 
                    concepts such as lists, dictionaries, classes, functions and loops, and practice 
                    writing clean and readable code with exercises for each topic. Students will also 
                    learn how to make programs interactive and how to test code safely before adding it 
                    to a project. It is a fast-paced, thorough introduction to programming with Python 3.6 
                    that will have students writing programs, solving problems, and making things that work 
                    in no time.
                </p>
                <li>Introduction to Linear Algebra and Statistics</li>
                <p>
                    In this module, students will learn the basic mathematical and statistical concepts 
                    that are needed to practice data science and understand deep learning. Students will 
                    also implement these concepts in Python and TensorFlow.

                <li>Advanced Python Libraries with Anaconda</li>
                <p>
                    In this module, students will be introduced to Anaconda, the leading open data science 
                    platform powered by Python. The open source version of Anaconda is a high performance 
                    distribution of Python and R and includes over 100 of the most popular Python and R 
                    packages for data science, such as NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.
                </p>
                <li>Data Science Essentials</li>
                <p>
                    In this module, students will learn key concepts and techniques used to perform data 
                    science; including statistical analysis, data cleansing and transformation, and data 
                    visualization with Python.
                </p>
                <li>The Fundamentals of Deep Learning with Keras with TensorFlow Backend</li>
                <p>
                    Before implementing deep-learning algorithms, students will first become familiar with 
                    the mathematical blocks of the neural networks theory. Students will get a chance to get 
                    their hands dirty writing some simple Keras code right away! Then they will move on to 
                    advanced deep learning concepts. This module will also cover some essential advantages 
                    of Keras to prove itâ€™s the deep-learning library of choice.

            <ul>
                <li>Introduction to Linux and Bash</li>
                <p>
                    Linux containers are poised to take over the world. In this module, students will 
                    begin learning with an introduction of Linux and the command line interface. For many 
                    non-technical people, the command line (also referred to as CLI, Terminal, bash, or shell) 
                    is a place of mystery. However, knowledge of only a handful of basic commands is enough 
                    to start feeling comfortable. In this module, we will cover the basic commands to 
                    get you started.

                <li>Docker Deep Dive</li>
                <p>
                    This module provides a soup-to-nuts learning experience for core Docker technologies, 
                    including the Docker Engine, Images, Containers, Registries, Networking, Storage, and 
                    more. All of the behind the scenes theory is explained, and all concepts are clearly 
                    demonstrated on the command line. No prior knowledge of Docker or Linux is required.
                </p>
                <li>Python Microservices Development</li>
                <p>
                    In recent years, REST (REpresentational State Transfer) has emerged as the standard 
                    architectural design for web services and web APIs. In this module, students will 
                    learn how easy it is to create a RESTfulweb service using Python and Flask.
                </p>
                <li>Build AI Microservices for ContainerDeployments</li>
                <p>
                    n this module, students will learn to use containers to simplify AI solution 
                    deployments and implement continuous integration and deployment strategies.

                <li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Practice</li>
                <p>
                    This module is structured around a series of practical code examples, demonstrating 
                    on real world problems. PIAIC strongly believes in the value of teaching using concrete 
                    examples, anchoring theoretical ideas into actual results and tangible code patterns. 
                    These examples all rely on Keras, the Python deep learning library. Students will 
                    learn Deep Learning for computer vision, text and sequences, finance, and advanced 
                    neural network design.
