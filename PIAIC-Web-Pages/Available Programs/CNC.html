            <dt>1A- Introduction to Cloud Native Computing</dt>
            <dd>
                Cloud native computing uses open-source software stacks to deploy applications as microservices, 
                packaging each part into its own container and dynamically orchestrating those containers to optimize 
                resource utilization. In the last 15 years, cloud application delivery has moved from being bound to 
                physical servers to running on virtual machines with a full operating system and now to containers with 
                Docker, where developers can specify every aspect of deployment.

            <dt>1B- Introduction to Linux and Bash using Python</dt>
            <dd>
                Linux containers are poised to take over the world; we will start our course with an 
                introduction of Linux and the command line. For many non-technical people, the command line 
                (also referred to as CLI, Terminal, bash, or shell) is a place of mystery. However, you only 
                have to know a handful of basic commands to start feeling comfortable. In this module we will 
                cover the basic commands to get you started.
            </dd>
            <dt>1C- Docker Deep Dive</dt>
            <dd>
                This course provides a soup-to-nuts learning experience for core Docker technologies, 
                including the Docker Engine, Images, Containers, Registries, Networking, Storage, and more. 
                All of the behind the scenes theory is explained, and all concepts are clearly demonstrated 
                on the command line. No prior knowledge of Docker or Linux is required.

            <dt>1D- JavaScript/TypeScript Programming</dt>
            <dd>
                JavaScript is the default language of the web and the first universal programming language. 
                In this module, students will dig through all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, 
                including syntax, objects, functions, inheritance, arrays, methods, etc. This module will 
                build a solid foundation in functional and object-oriented programming using JavaScript 
                (ES 2016) and TypeScript using Node.js. Assuming no prior programming experience on the part 
                of the student, this module starts by focusing on the fundamentals of composing code with 
                JavaScript. Introduction to only server based JavaScript/TypeScript is covered i.e. Node.js. 
                Students will also learn about the syntax and structure of the language including operators 
                and expressions, control structures, methods, and arrays using Node.

            <dt>2A- Advanced Python Libraries with Anaconda</dt>
            <dd>
                In this module, students will be introduced to Anaconda, the leading open data science 
                platform powered by Python. The open source version of Anaconda is a high performance 
                distribution of Python and R and includes over 100 of the most popular Python and R packages 
                for data science, such as NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.
            </dd>
            <dt>2B- Data Science Essentials</dt>
            <dd>
                In this module, students will learn key concepts and techniques used to perform data science; 
                including statistical analysis, data cleansing and transformation, and data visualization 
                with Python.
            </dd>
            <dt>2C- The Fundamentals of Deep Learning with Keras with TensorFlow Backend</dt>
            <dd>
                Before implementing deep-learning algorithms, students will first become familiar with the 
                mathematical blocks of the neural networks theory. Students will get a chance to get their 
                hands dirty writing some simple Keras code right away! Then they will move on to advanced 
                deep learning concepts. This module will also cover some essential advantages of Keras to 
                prove itâ€™s the deep-learning library of choice.

                Linux containers are poised to take over the world. In this module, students will begin 
                learning with an introduction of Linux and the command line interface. For many non-technical 
                people, the command line (also referred to as CLI, Terminal, bash, or shell) is a place of 
                mystery. However, knowledge of only a handful of basic commands is enough to start feeling 
                comfortable. In this module, we will cover the basic commands to get you started.

            <dd>
                In recent years, REST (REpresentational State Transfer) has emerged as the standard 
                architectural design for web services and web APIs. In this module, students will learn 
                how easy it is to create a RESTfulweb service using Python and Flask.

            <dt>Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Practice</dt>
            <dd>
                This module is structured around a series of practical code examples, demonstrating on 
                real world problems. PIAIC strongly believes in the value of teaching using concrete examples, 
                anchoring theoretical ideas into actual results and tangible code patterns. These examples 
                all rely on Keras, the Python deep learning library. Students will learn Deep Learning for 
                computer vision, text and sequences, finance, and advanced neural network design.
