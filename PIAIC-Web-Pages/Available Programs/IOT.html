        <dl>
            <dt>1A- Version Control with Git</dt>
            <dd>
                You won't find a top programmer, web developer, or AI engineer who doesn't use version control. 
                This is true because version control helps developers produce better results and makes 
                collaboration easy. Around the world, in teams both large and small, Git is an essential part 
                of the toolchain. This module covers Git and Github.
            </dd>
            <dt>2A- Object Oriented and Functional Programming using Python</dt>
            <dd>
                In the second module of the program, students will learn about basic programming concepts 
                such as lists, dictionaries, classes, functions and loops, and practice writing clean and 
                readable code with exercises for each topic. Students will also learn how to make programs 
                interactive and how to test code safely before adding it to a project. It is a fast-paced, 
                thorough introduction to programming with Python 3.6 that will have students writing programs, 
                solving problems, and making things that work in no time.
            </dd>
            <dt>3A- Introduction to Linear Algebra and Statistics</dt>
            <dd>
                In this module, students will learn the basic mathematical and statistical concepts that 
                are needed to practice data science and understand deep learning. Students will also 
                implement these concepts in Python and TensorFlow.

            <dt>2A- Advanced Python Libraries with Anaconda</dt>
            <dd>
                In this module, students will be introduced to Anaconda, the leading open data science 
                platform powered by Python. The open source version of Anaconda is a high performance 
                distribution of Python and R and includes over 100 of the most popular Python and R packages 
                for data science, such as NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.
            </dd>
            <dt>2B- Data Science Essentials</dt>
            <dd>
                In this module, students will learn key concepts and techniques used to perform data science; 
                including statistical analysis, data cleansing and transformation, and data visualization 
                with Python.
            </dd>
            <dt>2C- The Fundamentals of Deep Learning with Keras with TensorFlow Backend</dt>
            <dd>
                Before implementing deep-learning algorithms, students will first become familiar with the 
                mathematical blocks of the neural networks theory. Students will get a chance to get their 
                hands dirty writing some simple Keras code right away! Then they will move on to advanced 
                deep learning concepts. This module will also cover some essential advantages of Keras to 
                prove itâ€™s the deep-learning library of choice.

            <dt>3A- Introduction to Linux and Bash</dt>
            <dd>
                Linux containers are poised to take over the world. In this module, students will begin 
                learning with an introduction of Linux and the command line interface. For many non-technical 
                people, the command line (also referred to as CLI, Terminal, bash, or shell) is a place of 
                mystery. However, knowledge of only a handful of basic commands is enough to start feeling 
                comfortable. In this module, we will cover the basic commands to get you started.
            </dd>
            <dt>3B- Docker Deep Dive</dt>
            <dd>
                This module provides a soup-to-nuts learning experience for core Docker technologies, 
                including the Docker Engine, Images, Containers, Registries, Networking, Storage, and more. 
                All of the behind the scenes theory is explained, and all concepts are clearly demonstrated 
                on the command line. No prior knowledge of Docker or Linux is required.
            </dd>
            <dt>3C- Python Microservices Development</dt>
            <dd>
                In recent years, REST (REpresentational State Transfer) has emerged as the standard 
                architectural design for web services and web APIs. In this module, students will learn 
                how easy it is to create a RESTfulweb service using Python and Flask.
            </dd>
            <dt>3D- Build AI Microservices for ContainerDeployments</dt>
            <dd>
                In this module, students will learn to use containers to simplify AI solution deployments 
                and implement continuous integration and deployment strategies.

            <dt>Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Practice</dt>
            <dd>
                This module is structured around a series of practical code examples, demonstrating on 
                real world problems. PIAIC strongly believes in the value of teaching using concrete examples, 
                anchoring theoretical ideas into actual results and tangible code patterns. These examples 
                all rely on Keras, the Python deep learning library. Students will learn Deep Learning for 
                computer vision, text and sequences, finance, and advanced neural network design.
