        <h1>Concept of Semantic Markups</h1>
        <p lang="en-us">
            These markups do not effect you code but it give more infromation about the text.<br> 
            These markups can be detected by other softwere/app. For example: Web-App design for blinds<br>
            <strong>This text in important</strong><br>
            <em>This text appear in itlic</em><br>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <h1>Use of quotations and blockquote</h1>
            This is not a simple text: <q>This is a quotation</q>
            <blockquote cite="https://html.com/">
                <p>
                    Okay, so this is the only bit of mandatory theory. In order to begin to write HTML, it helps if you know what you are writing.
                    HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.
                    The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial. For now, we will focus 
                    teaching you how to build rather than design.
